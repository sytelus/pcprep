# Code Review Guidelines

Throughly understand all of the code, understand goal of the project from PROJECT.md, understand guidelines from AGENTS.md and understand the design of the code. After you develop full understanding, perform a through code review Find any bugs or mistakes in the code and fix them. Add unit tests for these changes to protect again future re-introduction of these issues. Fix any type hinting and linting issues. If you see any opportunities to eliminate redundencies, duplication or complexity that should not be present in a good code, then do make those changes. Simplify where you see unneccesory complexities. If you find any opportunities to make code perform better in critical sections then do improve the performance. Ass missing documentation for anything that may not be obvious to future maintainers and may create surprise for them. Make sure code is clean, tidy and easy to follow and maintain in future.

After making above changes, re-run all unit tests and any end-to-end tests to make sure code remains fully functional and error free.
